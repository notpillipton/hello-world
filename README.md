I could say that I have thirty-five years of programming experience, but I don't think that self-taught BASICA and
an ancient pre-standard C++ course count for much.

I've recently picked coding back up with an interest in several specific areas of theory and development:
(1) Applications designed for adults with ADHD
(2) Pedagogical tools for exploring abstract concepts with concrete examples
(3) The space of ethical issues surrounding learning systems and decision systems
